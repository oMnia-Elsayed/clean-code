# clean-code

Bad code works until it's the year 2,000. Bad code is difficult to understand, more complex than it should be, not easy to test, and it makes other developers seethe with frustration.

But there's always room to learn.

# Clean Code Principles

**KISS:** Keep It Simple Stupid.

- It states that most systems should be kept as simple as possible

**DRY:** Don't Repeat Yourself. 

- It states that every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.

**YAGNI:** You Aren't Gonna Need It.

- A developer should not add functionality unless deemed necessary.

**Composition over inheritance:** Not an acronym, sadly.

- It's a principle where you design your types over what they do instead of over what they are.

**Favor readability:** It's not because a machine can read your code that another human can. 

- Particularly when working with multiple people on a project, always favor readability over conciseness.
- There's no point in having concise code if people don't understand it.

**Practice consistency:** This is arguably the overarching principle of all clean code principles. 

- If you decide to do something a certain way, stick to it throughout the entire project. 
- If you have no choice but to move away from your original choice, explain why in the comments.
